                    Our goals with creating Slurp Slop is to bring back the era of having to do authentic research and to save our planet.<br>
                    We feel that too many people have become reliant on AI and other low quality resources that they see on the internet.<br>
                    Because of that, the things we trust online for our day to day lives are dwindling. We also realize that tons of people are concerned<br>
                    about the environmental effects that AI has on our planet. Because of this, we developed an algorithm that not only cuts ou the actual<br>
                    web page element of the Gemini AI overview, but also stops the web page from reaching out to the server, effectively stopping the negative power use.<br><br>
                    We truly do hope that people will use our extension to not only help bring back a sense of academic wellness, but fight against the environmental defects of AI.

                <span id="how-it-works">
                    This extension mainly does three things: whitelist low quality websites (which you can also add on to), blocks ads, and removes the Gemini AI overview.<br>
                    We manage the low quality websites by using a JS file to sort all of the broad 'slop' websites, and then another script that cuts them from the webpage.<br>
                    The ad blocker and the AI removal act in the same way. However, when you use 'aggresive' mode, we created a script that blocks the internet request to the Gemini servers,<br>
                    which prevents the overview from generation. But because we also block the network request to the server, water gets saved from being contaminated from the AI servers.<br>
                    We managed to do this with an extensive script that works in tandem with a JSON file. We won't go into the specifics, but just to keep it a fun little secret.
