                    Our goals with creating Slurp Slop is to bring back the era of having to do authentic research and to save our planet.<br>
                    We feel that too many people have become reliant on AI and other low quality resources that they see on the internet.<br>
                    Because of that, the things we trust online for our day to day lives are dwindling. We also realize that tons of people are concerned<br>
                    about the environmental effects that AI has on our planet. Because of this, we developed an algorithm that not only cuts ou the actual<br>
                    web page element of the Gemini AI overview, but also stops the web page from reaching out to the server, effectively stopping the negative power use.<br><br>
                    We truly do hope that people will use our extension to not only help bring back a sense of academic wellness, but fight against the environmental defects of AI.
